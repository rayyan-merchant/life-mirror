# LIFE MIRROR — Agent-based Backend: instructions.md

Purpose: This document is a step-by-step implementation guide for refactoring the LifeMirror backend into a modern, agent-based architecture using

LangGraph + LangChain, with Guardrails for safety, DSpy for prompt optimization, and LangSmith for tracing & evals. It excludes any voice/audio analysis — do

NOT implement the voice agent. It does include image, photo, and video handling and storage.

1) Goals & constraints

Primary goal: Replace the monolithic Flask backend with an agent-based, traceable, safe, modular pipeline that:

Uses LangGraph for orchestration and LangChain for tools/pipelines.

Adds strict Guardrails (input + output validation, format enforcement).

Uses LangSmith to trace, log, and evaluate runs continuously.

Uses DSpy to automatically optimize prompts during development.

Stores user profiles, past conversations, images and videos, embeddings, and structured analysis results in an auditable, efficient manner.

Important constraints:

The system must not include any voice/ audio analysis (explicitly excluded).

Respect user privacy: require explicit consent for biometric-like analysis.

Keep outputs parsable (strict JSON) for downstream tooling and for Guardrails to validate.

2) High-level architecture

Client (web/mobile)


   └─> API Gateway (FastAPI)


         └─> LangGraph Orchestrator (service)


                ├─> Vision Agent(s)  (FaceAgent, FashionAgent, PostureAgent)

                ├─> Memory/Retriever  (Vector DB + PG cache)


                └─> Aggregator/Formatter -> Response


Infrastructure:


 - Object storage (S3/MinIO)


 - Relational DB (Postgres + pgvector OR MongoDB)


 - Vector DB (Qdrant/Weaviate/Milvus/Pinecone) *or* pgvector


 - Task queue (Celery/RQ/Dramatiq) + worker pool (GPU workers for CV)


 - Model serving: local GPU inference (YOLO/Pose), cloud LLM API (OpenAI/OpenRouter)


 - Guardrails service (guardrails.ai policies enforced in nodes)


 - LangSmith for tracing and evals


 - DSpy for prompt tuning (dev only)


Notes:

LangGraph orchestrates flows and calls the Agents (each agent can be a node that internally uses LangChain tools).

Heavy CV models (YOLO, pose estimation) should run in separate GPU-enabled worker processes or a model-serving layer.

3) Prerequisites & accounts

Cloud account for object storage (AWS/GCP/Wasabi) or self-hosted MinIO

PostgreSQL (managed or cloud) or MongoDB

Vector DB account (Pinecone / Qdrant / Weaviate / Milvus) OR pgvector on Postgres

LangSmith account + API key

Guardrails.ai account / library available

DSpy access (for prompt optimization) and API/CLI

LLM provider credentials (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic, or whichever you use)

GPU-enabled host(s) for heavy CV inference (NVIDIA GPUs) or cloud GPU instances

4) Repo layout and coding patterns (suggested)

Coding patterns:

Use FastAPI for HTTP endpoints.

Each Agent exposes a well-typed interface: run(input: dict, context: dict)-> dict .

All LLM and external API calls should be wrapped with a client library that adds: request metadata, timeouts, retries, and LangSmith instrumentation.

Keep I/O pure — agents should not write to DB directly but return structured outputs to the Orchestrator which will persist them.

5) Infrastructure & services to provision (step-by-step)

1. Provision relational DB (Postgres) with pgvector  extension OR provision managed vector DB.

2. Provision object storage bucket for user media (images + videos). Enable server-side encryption.

3. Provision or install vector DB (if not using pgvector). For early stages use pgvector to reduce system complexity.

4. Provision a Redis instance for Celery/RQ broker and caches.

5. Provision GPU-enabled worker pool for CV inference (YOLO, pose). These can be Docker containers on GPU VMs or k8s nodes.

6. Create secrets store and rotateable env var system (AWS Secret Manager, Vault).

7. Configure monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana) and error tracking (Sentry).

8. Acquire LangSmith and Guardrails keys; set up DSpy access.

9. Configure CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI) and deployment manifests.

6) Data model & storage design

High-level decisions:

Use object storage for raw images and video (store path/URL in DB).

Use Relational DB (Postgres) for structured data (users, consents, analysis metadata, sessions). Use pgvector  if you prefer to keep embeddings in

Postgres.

Use Vector DB (Qdrant/Weaviate/Milvus/Pinecone) if you need scale or multi-modal vector search features.

Suggested tables (Postgres)

users

id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
email TEXT,


name TEXT,
created_at TIMESTAMP,


consent JSONB -- track what user consented to


media (images & videos)

id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),


media_type VARCHAR('image','video'),

storage_url TEXT,


thumbnail_url TEXT,

keyframes JSONB, -- list of thumbnails + offsets


size_bytes BIGINT,

mime TEXT,

created_at TIMESTAMP,

metadata JSONB -- exif, camera info


analyses

id UUID PRIMARY KEY,

media_id UUID REFERENCES media(id),

agent VARCHAR,


result JSONB,

confidence FLOAT,


created_at TIMESTAMP,

langsmith_run_id TEXT


conversations (text history)

id UUID PRIMARY KEY,

user_id UUID,

session_id TEXT,


messages JSONB, -- [{role, content, ts}]

created_at TIMESTAMP


embeddings_meta

id UUID PRIMARY KEY,

media_id UUID NULL,

conversation_id UUID NULL,


text_excerpt TEXT,

vector VECTOR, -- if pgvector used


vector_id TEXT -- pointer to external vector DB

created_at TIMESTAMP


Important: keep raw images  & videos  ONLY in object storage and never embed binary in the DB.

7) Media ingestion (images + videos) — secure upload flow

Upload flow (recommended):

1. Client requests presigned upload URL from API (FastAPI endpoint). API validates user, file type and size limit, then returns presigned URL.

2. Client uploads directly to object storage (S3 or MinIO) using the presigned URL.

3. Client sends a media.create  request to API with the storage_url , mime type, and metadata.

4. API stores media record in DB, returns media_id .

5. API enqueues background jobs for heavy processing (embedding generation, keyframe extraction, face detection, posture detection) with media_id .

6. Workers pick up jobs, download media from object storage, process (generate thumbnails, keyframes, embeddings), write analysis results back to

analyses  table and store embeddings in vector DB.

Video-specific processing:

When job runs on a video: extract keyframes using shot detection (ffmpeg + pyannote or ffmpeg select filters).

Generate a poster (single representative thumbnail) and 3-10 keyframes (scene-level or sampled at fixed intervals) depending on duration.

For each keyframe: generate image embeddings and object/pose detections.

Optionally: compute an aggregated video-level embedding by averaging keyframe embeddings or using a pooling network.

Record the keyframes  list (offset seconds + thumbnail URL) in the media  table.

Sizing & quotas:

Max image size: 10MB (adjustable by plan)

Max video size: 100MB or user-plan-specific; use chunked/ multipart uploads for large files.

Enforce server-side scan for viruses if possible.

8) Agents — responsibilities, inputs/outputs, models, guardrails & starter prompts

Guiding rule: every agent must accept a typed input  JSON and MUST return a typed output  JSON that conforms to a Guardrails-compliant JSON

schema.

8.0 Agent list (no voice)

OrchestratorAgent  (LangGraph root)

FaceAgent  (face detection + Face++/landmarks + heuristics)

FashionAgent  (YOLO clothing detection + LLM fashion critique)

PostureAgent  (pose detection + biomechanical heuristics)

BioAgent  (text/bio vibe analysis)

EmbedderAgent  (text/image/video -> embeddings)

MemoryAgent  / RetrieverAgent  (semantic search, recall past analyses)

AggregatorAgent  (combine outputs, compute final scores)

FormatterAgent  (produce final JSON and human summary)

CompareAgent  (compare with celebs / past self)

8.1 FaceAgent

Responsibility: detect face(s), return Face++-style attributes (age, gender, emotion, beauty), landmarks, and MediaPipe landmarks; compute image-based

skin/sampling metadata.

Input:

{ "media_id": "...", "storage_url": "...", "options": { "require_landmarks": true } }


Output (Guardrails JSON skeleton):

{


  "faces": [

    {

      "face_id": "uuid",

      "bbox": [x,y,w,h],


      "landmarks": {"mp_index": {"x":123,"y":456}, ...},


      "age": 28,

      "gender": "male",


      "emotions": {"happiness": 0.8, "sadness":0.0, ...},

      "beauty": {"male_score": 70, "female_score": 65}


    }
  ],


  "inference_metadata": {"detector": "facepp", "model_version":"v1"}

}


Models/Tools: Face++ API (or a local face detector), MediaPipe FaceMesh, a wrapper to normalize different providers' outputs.

Guardrails: require faces.length > 0  for downstream attractiveness/posture flows; if faces.length == 0 , return a structured message with

error_code: no_face_found .

Starter prompt pattern (LLM use-case): Use LLM only for summarizing face attributes or drafting human-friendly text. Always ask the LLM to output strict

JSON and add a schema in the prompt.

8.2 FashionAgent

Responsibility: detect clothing items (object detection with YOLO/DETR), call LLM to produce critique and improvement suggestions, rating (1–100), and

itemized suggestions.

Input:

{ "media_id": "...", "keyframes": [...], "detected_items": ["jacket","jeans"] }


Output:

{

  "outfit_rating": 78,


  "items": ["jacket","jeans","sneakers"],


  "good": ["color coordination","fit"],


  "bad": ["wrinkled shirt"],

  "improvements": ["try a darker shoe","iron the shirt"],


  "roast": "friendly roast string (optional)"


}


Models/Tools:

Local YOLOv8 detection (GPU worker) for item detection.

CLIP/zero-shot classification for aesthetic labels (optional).

LLM (e.g., Llama or OpenAI) for critique — controlled by Guardrails to return JSON only.

Guardrails: the LLM must return outfit_rating  in [0,100] and items  must be subset of detected YOLO items. If mismatch, agent should fallback to a

deterministic rule: e.g., item suggestions = YOLO items.

Starter prompt skeleton (strict JSON):

System: You are a fashion critic that MUST output only valid JSON. Schema: {outfit_rating:int, items:list, good:list

User: Analyze the following detected items: [LIST] and the image URL: [URL]. Produce concise JSON.


8.3 PostureAgent

Responsibility: use a pose detection model to extract keypoints, compute biomechanical scores (head-neck, shoulder symmetry, spine verticality, hip tilt), and

return per-component scores plus an overall posture score.

Input:

{ "media_id": "...", "keyframe": {"url":"...","offset":2.3} }


Output:

{


  "keypoints": {"nose":[x,y],"left_shoulder":[x,y],...},


  "scores": {"head_neck": 80, "shoulders": 65, "spine": 72, "legs": 88},


  "final_score": 76,

  "analysis_text": "..."


}


Models/Tools:

YOLOv8 pose model or OpenPose, Mediapipe Pose.

Worker must normalize pixel distances by torso size (shoulder width) to avoid scale-dependence.

Guardrails: enforce numeric ranges and require final_score  between 0 and 100. If keypoints missing, return error_code:

insufficient_keypoints  and a helpful user-facing message.

Engineering notes:

Break posture scoring into small deterministic functions (head-neck, shoulders, spine, hips, legs). Unit test each.

Avoid claiming medical diagnoses; produce only heuristic suggestions and include a disclaimer.

Starter prompt: LLM only used to convert numerical insights into human-friendly advice; the heavy lifting must be deterministic code.

8.4 BioAgent  (text/bio analysis)

Responsibility: analyze user-written bio or conversation text to derive "vibe" categories, suggested improvements, and a short friendly summary.

Input:

{ "text": "user bio or profile text", "context": {"past_analyses": [...]} }


Output:

Models/Tools:

LLM (with Guardrails enforcing JSON format), embeddings for retrieval.

Guardrails: enforce non-judgmental language and disallow making sensitive attribute inferences.

Starter prompt skeleton:

System: You are an empathetic advisor. Always answer with valid JSON. Avoid identity-based judgments. Provide streng

User: Analyze the following text: "[TEXT]". Use context: [context].


8.5 EmbedderAgent

Responsibility: convert images, keyframes, videos, and text to embeddings and store them in the vector DB with metadata.

Input:

{ "media_id": "...", "type": "image|keyframe|video|text", "url": "..." }


Output:

{ "vector_id": "...", "db": "qdrant", "dim": 1536 }


Video-specific:

For videos, compute frame-level embeddings then pool (mean/weighted) to produce a single video_embedding_id  plus keep per-keyframe

embeddings for fine-grained search.

Models/Tools: CLIP-based image embeddings, or provider embeddings (OpenAI or self-hosted CLIP).

Guardrails: reject unsupported file types; if embedding fails, return error_code  and retry with lower-res thumbnail.

8.6 MemoryAgent  / RetrieverAgent

Responsibility: given a query (image, text) return relevant past analyses or profile snippets using vector similarity + filters (user_id, date range).

{ "vibe_summary": "Carefree & playful", "strengths": [...], "weaknesses": [...], "improvements": [...], "confide

Input: search vector + filters

Output: list of embedding_meta  with link to media/analysis

Design:

Implement hybrid retrieval: semantic (vector) + structured filters (Postgres). This reduces false positives.

8.7 AggregatorAgent  & FormatterAgent

Aggregator:

Responsibility: combine outputs from FaceAgent, FashionAgent, PostureAgent, BioAgent and compute final composite scores (e.g., attractiveness

ensemble) and a short explanation.

Must preserve all intermediate outputs and attach langsmith_run_ids  for traceability.

Formatter:

Responsibility: produce final API response and a plain-language summary for UI. Must enforce Guardrails JSON schema and attach confidence  fields.

Guardrails:

Final output schema must be validated by Guardrails before returning to the client. If Guardrails flags a violation (e.g., disallowed content), the

Orchestrator must sanitize output and include a warning  field.

9) LangGraph orchestration design & node definitions

High-level flow — For a single analyze/selfie  request:

1. Pre-validate (Guardrails) the request (size, mime type, consent).

2. Create media entry (persist URL + metadata) and return media_id  to Orchestrator.

3. Parallel: call EmbedderAgent  (thumbnail + keyframe embeddings), FaceAgent , and FashionAgent  on selected keyframes.

4. Wait for heavy tasks (if queued) — Orchestrator receives callbacks or polls job status.

5. Call PostureAgent  (may be parallel to FaceAgent) on portrait keyframe(s).

6. Call BioAgent  if user provided a bio text.

7. AggregatorAgent merges all results and computes composite scores.

8. FormatterAgent validates final JSON via Guardrails and returns result.

9. LangSmith: record run traces and attach run_id  in analysis DB record.

Node-level rules:

Every node should accept a context  object containing: user_id , media_id , langsmith_run_id , consent_flags , and

retrieval_snippets .

Nodes must be idempotent. If a node fails due to external API error, it should retry with exponential backoff (configurable).

Long-running nodes should offload work to background workers and return a job_id  so the orchestrator can resume later.

Error handling:

If a critical node fails (e.g., FaceAgent crashed), Orchestrator decides whether to:

Retry (transient error)

Skip the node and continue (if optional)

Abort with error (if required)

Log error details and LangSmith trace.

10) LangChain Tools & wrappers (how to implement)

Wrap each external model call inside a LangChain Tool that implements run(input)  and returns structured output.

Each tool should:

Accept typed inputs (Pydantic models)

Add LangSmith metadata (tool name, version)

Have a retry wrapper with exponential backoff

Sanitize and validate outputs using Guardrails before returning to agent logic

Example Tool interface (Python / pseudo):

class FaceTool(BaseTool):
    name = "face_tool"


    def run(self, media_url: str, options: dict):


        # request face++ or mediapipe


        # validate output

        # return structured dict


11) Guardrails: schemas and integration patterns

Why: Guardrails enforces both input and output contracts for LLMs and agents. This is crucial for predictable JSON outputs.

How to integrate:

Add Guardrails checks at:

API input layer (file type, size, consent)

After each LLM call (validate JSON schema) — if invalid, retry the LLM once with a stricter prompt

Before final response (Aggregator/Formatter) — if invalid, block response and return sanitized error.

Example Guardrails JSON schema (simplified):

- name: fashion_output


  fields:


    - name: outfit_rating


      type: integer


      required: true

      constraints:


        min: 0


        max: 100


    - name: items

      type: list


      items:


        type: string


    - name: improvements

      type: list


      items:


        type: string


Fallback strategy: If LLM repeatedly fails to produce valid JSON, use deterministic rules built from detector outputs (e.g., item list = YOLO detections).

12) Prompt design & context engineering principles (for the later prompt-generation

step)

Core principles:

1. System role always sets boundaries (tone, safety, required JSON schema).

2. Format constraint: demand exact JSON and provide schema in the prompt.

3. Few-shot examples: include 1–3 minimal examples of correct input -> correct JSON output.

4. Temperature: keep inference temperature=0  or very low when strict output required.

5. Chunk context: supply only the minimal context required (detected items, small embeddings snippet), not the whole user history.

6. Memory summarization: supply a short one-paragraph summary of past interactions rather than raw conversation.

7. Safety: include explicit instructions to avoid identity-based judgments; include do_not_explain_personal_attributes  rule.

Prompt Template (fashion LLM example):

SYSTEM: You are a professional fashion critic. You MUST return exactly valid JSON that conforms to schema: {outfit_r

USER: Detected items: ["jacket","shirt"]. Photo url: [URL]. Consider fit, color, formality, and current fashion tren

OUTPUT: <only JSON>


Context windows:

If you need more context because multiple analyses are being combined, pass the aggregated numeric results not the raw outputs.

13) DSPy workflow for prompt optimization (developer flow)

Goal: automatically iterate prompt variants to maximize objective metrics (JSON compliance, user-perceived helpfulness, alignment with YOLO detections,

minimal hallucination).

Steps:

1. Create a dataset of input cases: small representative set of images + expected outputs (gold labels where possible).

2. Define evaluation metrics: schema_validity (binary), semantic_accuracy (e.g. items overlap with YOLO detection), ROUGE/embedding-distance to gold

text, and toxicity.

3. Use DSpy to generate prompt variants and run them against the dataset.

4. Collect metrics and rank prompts.

5. Manually inspect top candidates, then run a second-stage refinement with more examples.

6. Push the chosen prompt/version into production and label the LangSmith runs with the prompt version.

Automation: schedule periodic re-runs of DSpy on new data (monthly) and automatically deploy improved prompts behind a feature flag for A/B testing.

14) LangSmith tracing & evaluation plan

Instrumentation:

Every agent run should call LangSmith start/finish with metadata  containing user_id , media_id , agent_name , prompt_version , and

vector DB ids.

Save LLM input , output  and model  details in LangSmith. For heavy CV models, log the model version & worker id.

Eval suites:

Schema compliance: test that the LLMs consistently produce valid JSON.

Detection alignment: compare LLM-found items to YOLO detections.

Bias/toxicity checks: automated toxicity scans on output.

Regression tests: make sure new prompt changes do not reduce performance on gold set.

Alerting:

Configure alerts if schema compliance drops below threshold or if avg latency for agent > SLO.

15) Testing, QA and CI/CD

Unit tests:

Each deterministic heuristic function (posture sub-scorer, landmark converter) must have unit tests.

Integration tests:

Mock external API calls (Face++, YOLO, LLM) and run orchestrator flows.

E2E tests:

Run a small suite of images through the full pipeline in staging and validate final JSON schema and correctness.

CI/CD:

On push to main  run unit tests and integration tests with mocks.

Deploy to staging manually. After sanity checks, promote to production.

16) Deployment & scaling guidelines

Dockerize agents and worker processes.

Use k8s for production with GPU node pools for CV workers.

Scale LangGraph orchestrator horizontally without shared state.

Use autoscaling for worker pods depending on queue length.

Batch small inference jobs to reduce per-call overhead for external LLM APIs.

17) Security, privacy & compliance checklist

Do immediately:

Move all API keys out of code and into secret store.

Use HTTPS for all traffic and presigned URLs for uploads.

Encrypt media at rest.

Log minimal PII and redact sensitive fields in logs.

Consent & opt-in:

Add per-feature consent toggles. Do not run attractiveness/personality analysis unless user explicitly opts in.

Add a privacy center page that explains how data is used and retention schedules.

Retention:

Default retention for raw media: 90 days (or per user plan). Allow user to delete media and all derived artifacts (embeddings, analyses) on request.

Disallowed:

Do not store face embeddings without strong consent and securing them; treat biometric-derived vectors as sensitive.

18) Monitoring & observability

LangSmith for request traces and run metadata.

Prometheus + Grafana: latency, error rate, queue length, GPU utilization, embedding ingestion rate.

Sentry for exceptions.

Audit logs for data deletion requests.

19) Step-by-step implementation roadmap (detailed)

Each step below is an actionable task that the engineer (or ChatGPT acting as an engineer) must complete in order. Each task should be committed as

small PRs and tested.

);


Final notes & recommended decisions (short)

Start small: get embeddings + face detection + fashion detection working with Guardrails before building the full posture heuristics.

Use pgvector initially for simplicity; move to Qdrant/Weaviate if multi-modal features or scale demand it.

Keep the user consent toggle at the top of the request flow: no biometric analysis without explicit opt-in.

Use LangSmith from day one to capture traces and enable fast debugging and comparison.
